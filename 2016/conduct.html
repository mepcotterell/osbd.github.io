										<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
									</header>

									<p>The Open Science in Big Data (OSBD) workshop is a community event intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the workshop and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the workshop.</p>

                                    <p>To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at OSBD required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

                                    <h3>The Short Version</h3>

                                    <p>OSBD is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.</p>

                                    <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any workshop venue, including talks.</p>

                                    <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for OSBD.</p>

                                    <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the workshop at the sole discretion of the workshop organizers.</p>

                                    <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

                                    <h3>The Longer Version</h3>

                                    <p>The participants of OSBD comprise people from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our workshop succeeds. We expect everyone attending the workshop to follow the following guidelines when interacting with others both inside and outside of our event. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing event.</p>

                                    <p>As attendees of the workshop,</p>

                                    <ul style="list-style: disc inside none; margin-left: 30px;">
                                        <li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</li>

                                        <li>We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.</li>

                                        <li>We pledge to welcome those interested in entering the big data and open science fields, and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our workshop. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.</li>

                                        <li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the workshop environment.</li>

                                        <li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, and will treat those outside our workshop with the same respect as people within our workshop.</li>

                                        <li>We pledge to help the entire workshop follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when workshop attendees violate this code by notifying a workshop organizer or talking privately with the person.</li>

                                    <p>This code of conduct applies to all workshop situations online and offline, including the IEEE BigData conference itself, mailing lists, forums, social media, social events associates with the conference, and one-to-one interactions.</p>

                                    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the workshop organizers.</p>
