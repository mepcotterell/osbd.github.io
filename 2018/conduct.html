												<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
											</header>

											<section>
												<p>
													The Open Science in Big Data (OSBD) workshop is a
													community event intended for networking and collaboration
													as well as learning. We value the participation of every
													member of the workshop and want all attendees to have
													an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly,
													all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy
													to other attendees throughout the workshop.
												</p>
												<p>
													To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees,
													speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers at OSBD
													required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.
													Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
												</p>

		                    <h3>The Short Version</h3>
												<p>
													OSBD is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
													workshop experience for everyone, regardless of
													gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
													appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
													tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.
												</p>
												<p>
													All communication should be appropriate for a professional
													audience including people of many different backgrounds.
													Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
													workshop venue, including talks.
												</p>
 												<p>
													Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other
													attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that
													harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes
													are not appropriate for OSBD.
												</p>
												<p>
													Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave
													the workshop at the sole discretion of the workshop
													organizers.
												</p>
												<p>
													Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly
													event for all.
												</p>

		                    <h3>The Longer Version</h3>
												<p>
													The participants of OSBD comprise people from around
													the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities,
													and experiences. It is through these differences that
													our workshop succeeds. We expect everyone attending
													the workshop to follow the following guidelines when
													interacting with others both inside and outside of our
													event. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive,
													successful, and growing event.
												</p>
												<p>
													As attendees of the workshop,
												</p>
												<ul style="list-style: disc inside none; margin-left: 30px;">
													<li>
														We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide
														a harassment- and bullying-free environment,
														regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender
														identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
														race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular,
														sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise
														exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
													</li>
													<li>
														We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
														acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors.
														As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want
														our own work to be cited or acknowledged.
													</li>
													<li>
														We pledge to welcome those interested in entering
														the big data and open science fields, and realize
														that including people with a variety of opinions and
														backgrounds will only serve to enrich our workshop.
														In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of
														various technologies, programming languages, and so
														on are welcome, but these should be done with respect,
														taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants
														are heard and feel confident that they can freely
														express their opinions.
													</li>
													<li>
														We pledge to welcome questions and answer them
														respectfully, paying particular attention to those
														new to the workshop environment.
													</li>
													<li>
														We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of
														the wider community and to respond to criticism
														respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that
														encourage productive debate and disagreement, and
														will treat those outside our workshop with the same
														respect as people within our workshop.
													</li>
													<li>
														We pledge to help the entire workshop follow the
														code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we
														see violations of the code of conduct. We will take
														action when workshop attendees violate this code by
														notifying a workshop organizer or talking privately
														with the person.
